Simple project to make use of DHT22 sensors to monitor temperature and
humidity at various locations.  Reports the various data points into 
an InfluxDB time-series database for analysis/monitoring.

## Setup
It is suggested you use a python 3.7 virtual environment and pip3 to
install the necessary requirements.  You can use the install.sh
